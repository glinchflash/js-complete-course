i starts at Zero and for as long as i is smaller then the lenght of movies-array (10)
it will add 1 to i when it did the document.write function

and it uses i as his value to say which index of the array has to be written
so he will create a ordered list (document.write ('<ol>))
and use the order of the array by using i as index-indicator
then close the ordered list with document.write
